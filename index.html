<p>I am currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Willamette
University in both Portland and Salem, Oregon. Previously, I worked as a Senior
Research Scientist at NVIDIA from 2017 to 2023, exploring a wide range of
topics from human vision and displays to computer vision and modeling. My
current research interests examine how neural networks organize
information and how to more effectively use networks to understand and
generate images and video. Given my experience in both industry and
academia, Iâ€™m always happy to discuss potential career paths with students.
<br></br>
I earned my undergraduate BS degrees in Biology and Psychology from the
College of William & Mary in 2011. Later I completed my graduate work at UC
Berkeley, earning an MS in Computer Science in 2016 and a PhD in Vision
Science in 2018. I became interested in Vision Science during undergrad when
I realized that I was stereo-blind and recovered my stereo vision through
vision therapy exercises. I first learned to code by writing basic scripting code
for experiments during the early part of my PhD at Berkeley. I was a very late
bloomer with regard to computer science, and this has given me a particular
interest in supporting students who are changing careers.
<br></br>
In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing, snowboarding, hiking, watercolor
painting, gardening, and doing house projects. I am also passionate about
helping people become the best they can be. I try to teach what I know and
learn as much as I can from those around me. My goal is to make a lasting
positive difference in the lives of others.</p>
